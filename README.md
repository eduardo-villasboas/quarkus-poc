# quarkus-poc

## If you need some help to run de project, please go to ([quarkus readme](./README-quarkus.md))

- This project is intent to make some test using rabbitMQ just to remember the technology and also to learn more about ***vert.x*** and reactive programming with quarkus in order to use this concepts in a commercial application, but I would like to help people who are learning this concepts, so I am maintaining this repository public ;)
