# quarkus-poc

## If you need some help to run de project, please go to ([quarkus readme](./README-quarkus.md))

- This project is intent to make some test using rabbitMQ just to remember the technology and also to learn more about ***vert.x*** and reactive programming with quarkus in order to use this concepts in a commercial application, but I would like to help people who are learning this concepts, so I am maintaining this repository public ;).
- This project has a more friendly configuration than found on ([quarkus-quickstarts projects](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts)) because I have used distinct names for channels exchanges and queues.
- This project is just to make some tests, so I do not recommend you use it. But if you have any questions you can send me DM on ([Linked-In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-villas-boas/)), and I will try to help you.
